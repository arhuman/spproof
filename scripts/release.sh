# release.sh: cut a release with minimal ceremony. Language-agnostic; the only
# project hooks are the quality gate and, where a version manifest exists, the
# file it lives in, so it drops into any standard repo.
#
# Derives the next semantic version from the Conventional Commits made since the
# last v* tag (feat -> minor, fix/other -> patch, ! or BREAKING CHANGE -> major,
# capped to minor while still on 0.x), lets the caller confirm or override it
# (pass the version as $1 for non-interactive use), runs the gate (`make audit`,
# this repo's target for vet, lint, staticcheck, vulncheck and coverage-gated
# tests), stamps CHANGELOG.md, the version pins in $pin_files
# (adoption snippets that name the released tag) and, for a Python package, the
# pyproject.toml `version` field (Go has no such manifest: its version comes
# from the tag via ldflags at build time), then commits, tags and pushes.
# Pushing the tag is what triggers .github/workflows/release.yml.
# An executable scripts/release-preflight.sh, when present, runs with the
# preconditions and can veto the release with project-specific checks.
# Everything fallible is checked before anything is mutated: the remote is
# fetched and must not have diverged, and leftovers of an interrupted run (a
# stale changelog stamp, an untagged release commit at the head) are refused,
# so a re-run can never double-stamp or stack a second release commit.
#
# jj-colocated repos are handled natively: the release branch resolves from the
# jj bookmark (git HEAD is permanently detached there) and the release commit
# is made and pushed with jj, then tagged with git on the shared .git store.
#
# Invoked by the Makefile `release` target (`make release`) when one exists,
# otherwise directly: `scripts/release.sh [vX.Y.Z]`.
